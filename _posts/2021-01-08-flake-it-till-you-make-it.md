Im beginner of android developer (Custom roms etc.)
You can follow me on [Github](github.com/hestayn). You can find my all source on here.
Also i share my builds/projects to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/u/hellyx0/profile/)
Sometimes i share my builds to [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/hellyx.10642995/).. I said sometimes because usually users prefer **Telegram**
I do this for fun. Because i dont earn anything and i dont have to do it. I just trying to develop my own device and share it to other users.
